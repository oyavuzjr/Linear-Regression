    "### What are models?  \n",
    "\n",
    "A model is an (often simplified) representation of phenomena that occurs in the real world.  \n",
    "A statistical or machine learning model often requires data related to the phenomena that it is trying to model.\n",

    "### What is regression?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, regression is the study of dependance between variables.  \n",
    "More often than not, we are more interested in a specific variable which we call the **response variable**.  \n",
    "We often use one or more **explanatory variables** in order to study their relationship to the response variable, the one we are more interested in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I am interested in understanding why trees have a specific volume.  \n",
    "The relationship between the volume and other properties of the tree can be modeled.  \n",
    "There are many forces of nature such as gravity, carbon dioxide levels, minerals in the soil, etc that affects what a tree's volume might be. In \"modeling\" this relationship, we are greatly simplifying the true relationship by only trying to describe a tree's volume using the data that we have at our disposal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, since I am specifically interested in the volume, we would choose this as our **response variable**.  \n",
    "The **explanatory variables** would be whatever data I have related to the girth, such as the height or volume of the tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What does regression help us do?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression helps us understand the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables.  \n",
    "After we have created the linear regression model, we can use it to predict response variables using the explanatory variables."
